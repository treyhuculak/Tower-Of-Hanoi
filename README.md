#Tower of Hanoi

This is a script built at my time at UBCO. 

It uses assembly code to complete the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with a specified number of rings as given by the user.

The rules for Tower of Hanoi is as follows:
- The rings begin by being stacked all together on one peg with the smallest ring on top, down to the largest ring on the bottom
- The rings can only be moved one at a time
- A larger ring must not be placed on a smaller ring
- You can only move a ring that is on the top of a stack
- Your goal is to move the stack of the specified number of rings to a different peg, finished with it going from smallest to largest from the top down
